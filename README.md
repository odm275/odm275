### Hi there 👋🏼

I'm a full-stack developer in Houston, Texas.

I lead and take part in discussing projects with clients and guide them from ideas to reality, work with designers to produce mock ups, and develop fullstack web applications.

I am interested in building Software practically, efficiently, and painlessly. That includes Typescript, tRPC, GraphQL, and Next.js.
